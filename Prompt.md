AidBridge Connect is a non-profit revolutionizing disaster relief by connecting corporate surplus goods with affected communities, aiming to prevent the vast waste of donations often seen post-disaster. 

Despite good intentions, an estimated 50-70% of goods donated in the aftermath of natural disasters currently end up in landfills or are misdirected. Their impact is limited by escalating disaster scale and frequency. Their lean team of 25 core operations staff is overwhelmed by manual complexities: matching diverse corporate donations (5,000 unique product types annually from 300+ corporate partners) to real-time needs now takes 3-5 days per large donation, causing critical delays. Tracking over 10,000 annual shipments is manual, leading to 20-30% of deliveries facing delays or misrouting. Transparent tracking of millions of individual items is nearly impossible, hindering donor reporting. This manual burden creates significant delays and inefficiencies, directly impacting their core mission of maximizing aid delivery and minimizing waste

Your mission is to design an Agentforce-powered solution that enables AidBridge Connect to automate matching, streamline logistics, and improve real-time tracking to allow them to scale their vital mission and ensure more aid reaches those who need it most.
